                The U.S. team has appeared in eleven FIFA World Cups, including the first in 1930, where 
                they reached the semi-finals. They returned in 1934 and 1950, defeating England 1–0 in the latter, 
                but did not qualify again until 1990. As host in 1994, the U.S. received an automatic berth and lost 
                to Brazil in the round of sixteen. They qualified for the next five World Cups (seven consecutive appearances 
                (1990–2014), a feat shared with only seven other nations),becoming one of the tournament's regular competitors 
                and often advancing to the knockout stage. The U.S. reached the quarter-finals in 2002, and controversially 
                lost to Germany. In the 2009 Confederations Cup, the Americans eliminated top-ranked Spain in the semi-finals
                 before losing to Brazil in the final, the team's only appearance in the final of a major intercontinental tournament.
